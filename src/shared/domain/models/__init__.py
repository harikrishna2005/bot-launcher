Pro-Tips for Documentation:
The "Summary Line": The first line of a docstring should be a short summary.

The "Why": Don't just say what is in the file; explain where the data comes from (e.g., "generated internally" vs "fetched from exchange").

Class Level: You should also add a smaller docstring inside each class.
